A simple mowers


This project requires java 8 to run. And the launch scripts expect a unix environment (Linux, OSX will do).

```sh
# Package it
mvn clean package

# packaged to a tar.gz file
ls -l target/mower-42.0-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz


# run it from target, and discover usage
./target/mower/bin/mower.sh

# run it from target with instruction file to mow
# expected encoding is UTF-8, can be overridden with --encoding
./target/mower/bin/mower.sh \
    --mowers-input mower-instructions.txt \
    --mowers-output mowers-location.txt
```
