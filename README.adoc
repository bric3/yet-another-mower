=== A simple mowers orchestrator

This project requires java 8 to run. And the launch scripts expect a unix environment (Linux, OSX will do).

```sh
# Package it
mvn clean package

# packaged to a tar.gz file
ls -l target/mower-42.0-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz


# run it from target, and discover usage
./target/mower/bin/mower.sh

# run it from target with instruction file to mow
# expected encoding is UTF-8, can be overridden with --encoding
./target/mower/bin/mower.sh \
    --mowers-input mower-instructions.txt \
    --mowers-output mowers-location.txt
```


=== Future improvements :

- [ ] Learn programming to babies, or at the very least take care of
      themselves in order to be able to get more time.
- [ ] Use file channels to improve file performance, extends `Mowers.MowerBuilder` to
      pass Channel based implementation for reader and writer
- [ ] Improve parsing code
- [ ] Possibly remove some enums
- [ ] Explore engine as a state-machine
- [ ] Capture Ctrl-C via shutdown hook, and interrupt gracefully the program
- [ ] REST server
- [ ] Java 9, try `jlink`
